He didn't want to just illuminate a small patch of sidewalk; he wanted to be a star. He tried to shine brighter, hoping a passing comet might notice him.

Crying, she lost sight of it in the darkness. Edison, seeing her distress, put all his effort into one magnificent surge of light, shining far brighter than ever before. For a single, brilliant moment, his orange glow illuminated the lost drawing, pinned against a tree branch. The little girl found her masterpiece and looked up at Edison with a grateful smile.

He took Forky and also grabbed a piece of bread from a basket on the table. He showed his daughter how to spear a piece of bread with Forky's tines and then use the bread to soak up the delicious soup. It was a revelation! The little girl giggled as she ate her entire meal using the fork-and-bread contraption. Forky had never felt so useful. He realized he didn't need to be a spoon to scoop up soup. He just needed to be a clever fork with a good partner."

                fullText: "In a dusty antique shop sat a small, mahogany clock named Horatio. Unlike the other clocks, who proudly marched forward, ticking off the seconds, Horatio's hands swept counter-clockwise. He didn't tick; he tocked. The other antiques mocked him. 'He's unraveling time!' cackled a grandfather clock. 'An utter disgrace to horology!' hissed a cuckoo clock. Horatio was lonely, as no one wanted a clock that couldn't tell them what time it was, but only what time it had been. The shopkeeper, a kind old man named Mr. Gable, would just polish him gently and say, 'Your time will come, my friend.' One day, a woman came into the shop, her eyes red with tears. She had lost a precious locket her grandmother had given her, a locket she remembered holding just that morning. She was distraught, trying to retrace her steps, but her memory was a jumble of stress. Mr. Gable had a thought. He brought Horatio to the woman and set him on the counter. 'Watch this,' he said. The little clock's hands began to move backwards, tocking softly. 'Ah,' said the woman, her eyes following the hands. 'An hour ago... I was paying for my newspaper.' The hands moved further. 'Three hours ago... I was at the cafe.' As the clock's hands swept backwards, so did her memory, becoming clearer and more organized with each tock. 'Wait!' she gasped. 'I remember now! I took it off to wash my hands at the cafe!' She rushed out of the shop, only to return an hour later, the silver locket gleaming in her hand. She bought Horatio on the spot. He didn't just tell time; he found lost time.",

On this sunny Tuesday morning, she packed her backpack carefully with water, snacks, and her trusted compass. She had been hiking for about two hours when she stopped for a break beside a crystal-clear stream. As she reached for her compass to check her direction, her heart sank. The compass was gone! It must have fallen out somewhere along the trail. Sarah took a deep breath and remembered her training: stay calm, think clearly, and use what you know. She looked at the sun's position and remembered it was still morning, so the sun was in the east. She could see moss growing on the north side of the nearby trees. Using these natural clues, Sarah figured out which direction would lead her back to the trailhead. She walked slowly and carefully, marking her path with small stone cairns. After thirty minutes of careful navigation, she spotted something glinting in the sunlight. There was her compass, lying beside the trail where she had stopped earlier to take a photograph! Sarah smiled as she picked up her compass and continued on her hike, grateful for the natural navigation skills that had helped her find her way.",
