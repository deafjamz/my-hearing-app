# Session Log

## Session: [Current Date]
- **Summary:** Completed the `RapidFire` module refactor to a stable, single-button UX. Fixed the auto-play and predictable answer bugs. Implemented the new "Slate/Cyberpunk" visual identity and gamified streak flame.
- **Known Issues:** The audio file for the word "Time" (`time.mp3`) is suspected to be missing from the asset library. A full audit of `wordPairs.ts` against available audio files is required as a next step.
