## Step-by-Step Formation

### Step 1: Choose a Registered Agent (~$50-60/year)

A registered agent receives legal documents on your behalf. Wyoming requires one.

**Recommended services:**
1. **Wyoming Registered Agent** - $25/year (basic)
2. **Northwest Registered Agent** - $125/year (includes business address)
3. **Incfile** - $119/year

**Why you need this:** Your personal address won't appear on public records.

### Step 2: Name Your LLC

**Format:** `SoundSteps LLC` or `SoundSteps, LLC`

**Check availability:**
1. Go to: https://wyobiz.wyo.gov/Business/FilingSearch.aspx
2. Search for "SoundSteps"
3. Verify no exact matches

**Name requirements:**
- Must include "LLC" or "Limited Liability Company"
- Cannot include restricted words (Bank, Insurance, University)
- Cannot be deceptively similar to existing entities

### Step 3: File Articles of Organization

**Option A: Online (Recommended)**
1. Go to: https://wyobiz.wyo.gov
2. Select "Online Filings" → "Domestic LLC"
3. Complete the form:
   - **LLC Name:** SoundSteps LLC
   - **Registered Agent:** Your chosen agent's info
   - **Organizer:** Can be anyone (doesn't appear on public record after filing)
   - **Management:** Member-managed (you manage it) vs Manager-managed
4. Pay $100 filing fee
5. Receive stamped Articles via email (usually same day)

**Option B: Mail**
- Download form: https://sos.wyo.gov/Forms/Business/LLC/LLC-ArticlesOrganization.pdf
- Mail to: Wyoming Secretary of State, Herschler Building East, 122 W 25th St, Cheyenne, WY 82002
- Include $100 check
- Takes 5-10 business days

### Step 4: Create an Operating Agreement (Critical!)

This internal document defines ownership and rules. Wyoming doesn't require filing, but **you need one** to:
- Establish you as the sole member
- Maintain liability protection
- Define how profits/losses are handled
- Set rules for adding future members

**Template structure:**
```
OPERATING AGREEMENT OF SOUNDSTEPS LLC

1. FORMATION
   - Name: SoundSteps LLC
   - State: Wyoming
   - Principal Office: [Your address or virtual office]
   - Purpose: Develop and operate software applications

2. MEMBER
   - [Your Name] - 100% ownership interest

3. CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS
   - Initial contribution: $[amount]

4. MANAGEMENT
   - Member-managed
   - Member has full authority over business decisions

5. DISTRIBUTIONS
   - Profits distributed at member's discretion

6. DISSOLUTION
   - Upon member's written decision to dissolve

Signed: _______________ Date: _______________
```

**Free template resources:**

### Step 5: Get an EIN (Free)

**Employer Identification Number** - Your business's Social Security number.

1. Go to: https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online
2. Select: "View Additional Types, Including Tax-Exempt and Governmental Organizations"
3. Choose: "Limited Liability Company"
4. Complete application (takes ~10 minutes)
5. **Immediately receive EIN** - Save/print this!

**You need an EIN to:**
- Open a business bank account

- Hire contractors
- Accept payments (Stripe/App Store)

### Step 6: Open a Business Bank Account

**Recommended banks:**
1. **Mercury** - Free, online, startup-friendly
2. **Relay** - Free, multiple accounts
3. **Chase** - Traditional, good integration

**Documents needed:**
- Articles of Organization (from Step 3)
- Operating Agreement (from Step 4)
- EIN letter (from Step 5)
- Valid ID

**Critical:** Keep personal and business finances completely separate. Mixing them can "pierce the corporate veil" and eliminate liability protection.

### Step 7: Annual Requirements

**Wyoming Annual Report:**
- Due: First day of anniversary month
- Cost: $60 (or $2/each $1000 of Wyoming assets, min $60)
