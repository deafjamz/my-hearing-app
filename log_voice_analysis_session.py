Discovered that current female voice (147.4Hz) is suboptimal for CI users. Found 6 new female voices in optimal 165-265Hz range. Developed systematic F0 gap training strategy (25Hz ‚Üí 15Hz ‚Üí 10Hz progression) with clinical research backing. Decided on 'voice variety enhancement' approach rather than explicit F0 training to maintain user engagement.",

Develop progressive voice expansion system\\n4. Consider optional 'Voice Detective' advanced module\\n5. Validate voice improvements with beta CI users\\n6. Document clinical methodology for industry credibility",
