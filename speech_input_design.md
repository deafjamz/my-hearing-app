# Speech Input System Design for CI Rehabilitation

## Overview
The speech input system allows users to provide open-ended verbal responses, expanding beyond multiple-choice answers to include more natural, conversational rehabilitation practice.

## Core Components

### 1. Web Speech API Integration
- **SpeechRecognition API**: Browser-native speech-to-text
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Chrome, Safari, Firefox support
- **Language models**: Optimized for English with CI user considerations
- **Noise handling**: Robust recognition in various acoustic environments

### 2. Audio Input Management
- **Microphone permissions**: Secure, user-controlled access
- **Audio level monitoring**: Visual feedback for optimal recording
- **Background noise detection**: Adaptive sensitivity adjustment
- **Recording controls**: Start/stop, retry, playback options

### 3. Response Analysis Engine
- **Keyword extraction**: Identify key concepts in user responses
- **Semantic analysis**: Understand intent beyond exact word matching
- **Confidence scoring**: Rate response appropriateness and clarity
- **Partial credit**: Recognize correct elements in incomplete responses

### 4. Clinical Assessment Integration
- **Speech clarity metrics**: Analyze articulation and pronunciation
- **Response completeness**: Evaluate comprehensiveness of answers
- **Reaction time tracking**: Monitor processing and response speed
- **Progress measurement**: Track improvement over time

## Technical Implementation

### Speech Recognition Setup
```javascript
class SpeechInputManager {
    constructor() {
        this.recognition = new (window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition)();
        this.isRecording = false;
        this.setupRecognition();
    }
    
    setupRecognition() {
        this.recognition.continuous = false;
        this.recognition.interimResults = true;
        this.recognition.lang = 'en-US';
        this.recognition.maxAlternatives = 3;
    }
}
```

### Response Evaluation Framework
```javascript
class ResponseEvaluator {
    evaluateResponse(expectedAnswer, userResponse, context) {
        return {
            keywordMatch: this.analyzeKeywords(expectedAnswer, userResponse),
            semanticScore: this.calculateSemanticSimilarity(expectedAnswer, userResponse),
            clarityScore: this.assessSpeechClarity(userResponse),
            completeness: this.evaluateCompleteness(expectedAnswer, userResponse, context),
            overallScore: this.calculateOverallScore()
        };
    }
}
```

## UI/UX Design

### Recording Interface
- **Visual Waveform**: Real-time audio visualization
- **Recording State**: Clear start/stop/listening indicators
- **Confidence Meter**: Show recognition confidence in real-time
- **Retry Mechanism**: Easy re-recording for unclear responses

### Feedback System
- **Immediate Response**: Quick acknowledgment of input received
- **Analysis Results**: Detailed breakdown of response evaluation
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Specific tips for better responses
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress through speech exercises

## Integration Points

### Existing Activities
- **Story Comprehension**: Open-ended questions about story content
- **Scenario Practice**: Conversational responses in functional scenarios
- **Sentence Recognition**: Repeat-back exercises for accuracy
- **Keyword Practice**: Expanded responses beyond single word identification

### Gamification Integration
- **Speech Badges**: Awards for clear speech, complete responses
- **Garden Growth**: Speech practice contributes to Sound Garden watering
- **CI Rings**: New "Expression Ring" for speech output practice
- **Streak Tracking**: Consecutive days with speech practice

## Clinical Considerations

### CI-Specific Adaptations
- **Processing Time**: Extended timeouts for CI processing delays
- **Audio Quality**: Tolerance for CI-processed speech characteristics
- **Vocabulary Focus**: Medical, functional, and daily life terminology
- **Difficulty Progression**: Gradual complexity increase

### Assessment Metrics
- **Speech Intelligibility**: Clarity and understandability scores
- **Response Accuracy**: Correctness of content and context
- **Fluency Measures**: Rate, rhythm, and natural speech patterns
- **Confidence Building**: Self-assessment and comfort levels

## Privacy and Security
- **Local Processing**: Speech processing on-device when possible
- **Data Protection**: No storage of audio recordings
- **User Control**: Clear opt-in/opt-out for speech features
- **Accessibility**: Alternative input methods always available

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Speech Input
- Web Speech API integration
- Simple recording and transcription
- Basic keyword matching
- UI components for speech input

### Phase 2: Advanced Analysis
