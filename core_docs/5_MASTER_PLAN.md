## Sprint 1 Checklist (The Foundation)
1.  [Tech] Scaffolding: Vite + React + Capacitor + Supabase.
2.  [Design] Tailwind Config: Implement "Aura" tokens.
3.  [Data] SQL: Run the migration to create tables.
4.  [QA] Python: Create `verify_audio.py` script.

## The Critical Rule
**The Truth Layer:** Do not generate mass audio assets until the Python verification script is proven to accurately calculate RMS Amplitude on a test file.
