scn_shoe_store_04,scn_shoe_store,Customer,I usually wear a ten and a half.,4
scn_shoe_store_05,scn_shoe_store,Associate,You're actually closer to an eleven. That could be why you're having issues. Do you run on pavement or trails?,5

scn_home_repair_01,scn_home_repair,Contractor,Thanks for having me out. You said you have some water damage in the bathroom?,1

scn_home_repair_04,scn_home_repair,Homeowner,How much does something like this usually cost to fix?,4
scn_home_repair_05,scn_home_repair,Contractor,If it's just the shower seal we're looking at about two hundred. A pipe repair could be five hundred or more depending on access.,5

scn_eye_exam_glasses_03,scn_eye_exam_glasses,Optician,Not too much but you'll want a taller frame so the lens has room for all three zones. These rectangular frames work well.,3
scn_eye_exam_glasses_04,scn_eye_exam_glasses,Patient,I like these dark brown ones. How much are they?,4
scn_eye_exam_glasses_05,scn_eye_exam_glasses,Optician,The frames are two hundred and nineteen. With progressive lenses and anti-glare coating the total would be about four hundred and seventy.,5

scn_eye_exam_glasses_07,scn_eye_exam_glasses,Optician,Your plan covers a hundred and fifty toward frames and lenses. So your out of pocket would be around three hundred and twenty.,7

scn_hearing_aid_fitting_04,scn_hearing_aid_fitting,Patient,It feels a bit snug but not uncomfortable. Everything sounds much louder.,4
scn_hearing_aid_fitting_05,scn_hearing_aid_fitting,Specialist,I'll turn the volume down slightly. We start at about seventy percent and gradually increase over the next few weeks.,5
scn_hearing_aid_fitting_06,scn_hearing_aid_fitting,Patient,That's better. My own voice sounds strange though. Is that normal?,6
scn_hearing_aid_fitting_07,scn_hearing_aid_fitting,Specialist,Very normal. Your brain will adjust in about a week. Wear them at least eight hours a day to help with the adjustment.,7

scn_nutrition_consult_06,scn_nutrition_consult,Client,I could try that. What about breakfast? I usually skip it.,6
scn_nutrition_consult_07,scn_nutrition_consult,Nutritionist,Skipping breakfast often leads to overeating at lunch. Try oatmeal with berries. It takes five minutes and helps lower cholesterol.,7
scn_nutrition_consult_08,scn_nutrition_consult,Client,I'll give it a shot. When should I come back for a follow-up?,8
scn_urgent_care_01,scn_urgent_care,Nurse,What brings you in today?,1

scn_client_call_05,scn_client_call,Account Manager,That's tight. We'd need to get all your content and approvals by March fifteenth. Is that realistic on your side?,5
scn_client_call_06,scn_client_call,Client,I can commit to that. Will the earlier deadline affect the cost?,6
scn_client_call_07,scn_client_call,Account Manager,There may be a small rush fee of about ten percent for overtime hours. I'll send you a revised quote by end of day tomorrow.,7
