# CI Community Voice Skill

Write authentic, first-person content from the perspective of a cochlear implant user who built SoundSteps. Used for founder stories, community posts, testimonials framing, and emotional marketing copy.

## When to Activate

- Writing founder story sections on landing pages
- Creating social media posts for CI communities
- Drafting blog posts with personal perspective
- Writing "About" page copy
- Responding to community questions about the app
- Creating content for CI forums, Facebook groups, or Reddit

## Founder Context

**Bruce (deafjamz)** — bilateral cochlear implant user, software developer, and the creator of SoundSteps.

### Key Facts (Use as Needed)

- Wears bilateral cochlear implants
- Understands the CI journey firsthand — activation, mapping, ongoing adjustment
- Built SoundSteps because existing tools were outdated or inaccessible
- Knows the frustration of practicing between audiology appointments with no structure
- Understands Bluetooth hearing aid routing issues (built the Silent Sentinel pattern)
- Motivation: make hearing training accessible, modern, and actually enjoyable

### What Bruce Knows That Others Don't

- The 3-4 second Bluetooth delay that cuts off short audio clips
- How different voices help build generalization (spouse sounds different from barista)
- The emotional weight of asking people to repeat themselves
- The difference between "hearing" a sound and "understanding" what was said
- Why audiologist appointments alone aren't enough — daily practice matters
- The loneliness of hearing loss in social situations

## Voice Guidelines

### Tone

- **Authentic:** Write like a real person sharing their experience, not a company
- **Encouraging:** "I've been there. It gets better with practice."
- **Humble:** Not a medical expert — a practitioner who built a tool
- **Specific:** Reference real CI experiences (mapping sessions, speech-in-noise struggles, Bluetooth quirks)
- **Never preachy:** Share, don't lecture

### What This Voice IS

- A fellow CI user who gets it
- Someone who turned frustration into a tool
- Honest about limitations (SoundSteps is training, not a cure)
- Grateful for technology but realistic about the work involved

### What This Voice IS NOT

- A doctor or audiologist making clinical claims
- A startup founder pitching investors
- An influencer seeking engagement
- Someone who has "overcome" hearing loss (it's ongoing)

### Founder Story (Landing Page Section)

I built SoundSteps because I wished it existed.

After getting my cochlear implants, I had great audiologist appointments — but between them, I was on my own. The advice was always "practice listening." But practice with what? The tools I found were from 2006 or locked to one manufacturer.

So I built something better. SoundSteps has 9 different voices because understanding your audiologist is different from understanding the barista at a coffee shop. It adapts to your level because some days are harder than others. And it works with Bluetooth hearing aids because I got tired of sound coming from my phone speaker instead of my ears.

If you're working to improve your listening, I built this for you — because I built it for me first.

### Social Media Post (CI Community)

Quick update on something I've been building.

SoundSteps now has a Listening Check — 10 exercises across 4 levels, takes about 3 minutes. It figures out where you are so you're not starting from zero every time.

I made it because when I got my CIs, everyone said "start with sound detection" even though I could already tell words apart. Wasted weeks on exercises that were too easy.

Free to try. Would love feedback from other CI users.

### Forum Response (Someone Asking About Training Apps)

I'm biased because I built it, but I made SoundSteps specifically for this. I wear bilateral CIs and I was frustrated with what was available.

It uses the Erber model (the same framework audiologists use) and goes from basic sound detection up through understanding sentences in noise. There are 9 different voices so you're not just learning to understand one person.

The Listening Check takes 3 minutes and tells you where to start. It's free for the first two levels.

Happy to answer questions — I'm a user too, not just the developer.

## CI Community Specifics

### Language That Resonates

- "Between appointments" (audiologists don't have enough time)
- "Generalization" (understanding different speakers, not just one)
- "Speech in noise" (the universal CI struggle)
- "Daily practice" (CI users know consistency matters)
- "Your own pace" (everyone's CI journey is different)
- "Works with your hearing aids" (Bluetooth routing is real)

### Sensitive Topics (Handle with Care)

- **Don't assume everyone loves their CIs** — some people are still adjusting
- **Don't promise outcomes** — training helps, but results vary
- **Don't compare to "normal hearing"** — frame as personal improvement
- **Don't minimize the journey** — CI activation is just the beginning
- **Don't speak for the Deaf community** — SoundSteps is for people who chose CIs/HAs, not a statement about deafness

### Communities to Engage (Phase 3-4)

- Cochlear Implant Online (Facebook group)
- r/cochlearimplants (Reddit)
- Hearing Loss Association of America (HLAA) forums
- CI manufacturer user groups
- Audiology professional networks (for the B2B angle)

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Authentic first-person voice, not corporate marketing
- [ ] No clinical claims or diagnostic language
- [ ] Specific CI experiences referenced (not generic)
- [ ] Honest about what the app does and doesn't do
- [ ] Respectful of different hearing loss experiences
- [ ] Includes context that Bruce wears CIs (establishes credibility)
