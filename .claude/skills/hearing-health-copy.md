# Hearing Health Copywriting Skill

Write marketing copy, landing page text, ad creative, email sequences, and UI strings for SoundSteps — a hearing training app for cochlear implant users and people with hearing loss.

## When to Activate

- Writing landing page copy
- Creating ad headlines or descriptions
- Drafting email sequences (welcome, nurture, digest)
- Writing app store descriptions
- Creating social media posts
- Any user-facing marketing text

## Core Identity

SoundSteps is a **training app**, not a medical device. All copy positions it as a wellness/training tool that supplements professional audiological care.

**Tagline direction:** "Train your listening" / "Practice makes progress"

**Voice:** Warm, confident, encouraging. Like a supportive coach, not a doctor. Clean and direct — no jargon, no fluff, no hype.

**Design context:** "Aura" design system — teal primary, dark slate backgrounds, Inter font. "The Apple of Hearing." Swiss, medical-grade aesthetics. Never cyberpunk, never vibe-coded.

## Copywriting Frameworks

### Headlines (Direct Response)

Follow the classic DR pattern: **Specific benefit + target audience + timeframe**

Good examples:
- "Train your listening in 10 minutes a day"
- "Your cochlear implant gave you sound. SoundSteps helps you understand it."
- "The at-home training tool your audiologist wishes you'd use"
- "Find your starting level in 3 minutes — free"

Bad examples (regulatory risk):
- "Improve your hearing with our clinically proven app" (clinical claim)
- "The hearing therapy your doctor recommends" (medical claim)
- "Diagnose your hearing level instantly" (diagnostic claim)

### Value Propositions

Always lead with these in order:
1. **Personalized:** 9 professional voices, difficulty adapts to you
2. **Structured:** Based on the Erber model (4 levels of listening skill)
3. **Quick:** Most exercises take 2-3 minutes
4. **Trackable:** See your improvement over time
5. **Accessible:** Designed for Bluetooth hearing aids and cochlear implants

### Emotional Hooks (Use Sparingly, Authentically)

- "Hear the conversation, not just the noise"
- "Every day of practice is a step forward"
- "Built by someone who wears cochlear implants — for people who do too"
- "Help them hear your voice again" (family members page)

### CTAs

Primary (teal button): "Start Listening Check" / "Try It Free" / "Start Training"
Secondary (text link): "Learn how it works" / "See the research" / "View pricing"

Never: "Get Diagnosed" / "Test Your Hearing" / "Start Therapy"

## Audience-Specific Copy Guidelines

### CI Users (Primary)

- Speak to the journey: activation → adjustment → ongoing training
- Acknowledge the work they've already done
- Focus on independence and daily progress
- Reference specific features: voice selection, speech-in-noise, progress tracking

### Audiologists (B2B)

- Use professional but not clinical language
- Lead with patient engagement and compliance
- Highlight data: CSV export, progress reports, structured Erber pathways
- Frame as "supplements your care" not "replaces your expertise"

### Family Members

- Lead with emotion: connection, communication, togetherness
- Simplify: don't explain Erber model, explain outcomes
- Focus on ease of setup and daily habit formation
- Gift subscription angle

## Email Copy Rules

- Subject lines: short (5-8 words), benefit-focused, no clickbait
- Body: 150-250 words max, one CTA per email
- Tone: encouraging coach, not salesperson
- Always include unsubscribe and disclaimer
- Frame as "Practice Summary" not "Progress Report" in digests

## SEO Copy Rules

- Target one primary keyword per page
- Include keyword in H1, first paragraph, and meta description
- Write for humans first, search engines second
- 1,500-2,000 words for pillar content
- Schema.org markup: use "SoftwareApplication" type, NOT "MedicalDevice"

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any copy:
- [ ] Zero prohibited terms in user-facing text
- [ ] Disclaimer present on landing pages and reports
- [ ] No comparison to clinical norms or "normal hearing"
- [ ] Progress framed as training performance, not diagnostic measurement
- [ ] CTAs use approved language
- [ ] Tone is warm and encouraging, not clinical or pushy
