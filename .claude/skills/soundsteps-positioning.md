## Product Definition

**SoundSteps** is a web-based hearing training app for cochlear implant users and people with hearing loss. It provides structured listening practice across 4 Erber levels (Detection → Discrimination → Identification → Comprehension) with 9 professional AI voices, adaptive difficulty, Bluetooth hearing aid support, and detailed progress analytics.

### Core Differentiators

| Feature | Why It Matters | Competitors Lack This |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| Erber model progression | Structured, proven audiology framework | Most apps have no progression model |
| 9 voices (3 accents, M/F) | Builds generalization — real world has many speakers | Most have 1-2 voices |
| Bluetooth hearing aid routing | Audio actually reaches the ears via BT | Apps break on MFi/ASHA devices |
| Adaptive SNR (Smart Coach) | Difficulty adjusts to performance | Static difficulty |
| Placement Assessment | Personalized start, not "begin at level 1" | All start from zero |
| Daily Practice plans | Algorithm-driven, reduces decision fatigue | User must self-select |
| Phoneme mastery grid | Visual heatmap of sound pattern progress | No granular analytics |
| CSV export | Data for audiologists or personal records | Locked-in data |
| Modern web app (PWA) | Works on any device, no app store | Desktop-only or single-platform |
| Built by a CI user | Authentic, firsthand understanding | Built by companies, not users |

## Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs)

### ICP 1: CI User (Primary)

- **Who:** Adults with cochlear implants (unilateral or bilateral)
- **Stage:** Post-activation, in ongoing adjustment phase (months to years)
- **Pain:** "My audiologist says practice, but practice with what?"
- **Goal:** Understand speech better, especially in noisy environments
- **Channels:** CI Facebook groups, audiologist referral, Google search
- **Budget sensitivity:** Moderate — already invested heavily in hearing technology
- **Trigger:** Recent activation, mapping change, frustration with understanding in groups

### ICP 2: Hearing Aid User

- **Who:** Adults with moderate-to-severe hearing loss using hearing aids
- **Stage:** Adjusted to aids but struggling with speech clarity
- **Pain:** "I can hear sounds but can't understand words"
- **Goal:** Improve word discrimination, especially similar-sounding words
- **Channels:** Google search, audiologist referral, hearing aid forums
- **Budget sensitivity:** Variable — may already pay for premium aids

### ICP 3: Audiologist (B2B)

- **Who:** Licensed audiologists (Au.D.) in private practice or CI centers
- **Stage:** Looking for home practice tools to recommend
- **Pain:** "Patients don't practice between appointments and progress stalls"
- **Goal:** Improve patient outcomes and engagement
- **Channels:** Professional conferences (AAA, ACI Alliance), peer networks, LinkedIn
- **Budget sensitivity:** Low (not paying themselves) — recommending to patients

### ICP 4: Family Member

- **Who:** Spouses, adult children, caregivers of hearing-impaired adults
- **Stage:** Looking for ways to help
- **Pain:** "I want to help them but don't know how"
- **Goal:** Support their family member's hearing journey
- **Channels:** Google search ("how to help cochlear implant user"), caregiver forums
- **Budget sensitivity:** Low — willing to pay for something that helps

## Headline Generation Process

When generating headlines, always produce 3-5 variants using different emotional angles:

1. **Pain-aware:** Addresses the frustration directly
2. **Aspiration:** Paints the desired outcome
3. **Specificity:** Leads with a concrete feature or number
4. **Social proof:** References the community or experts
5. **Curiosity:** Creates an information gap

Example for CI Users page:
1. "Tired of 'just practice listening'? Here's what actually works." (pain)
2. "Understand the conversation, not just the noise." (aspiration)
3. "9 voices. 4 levels. 3 minutes to find your starting point." (specificity)
4. "Built by a CI user. Recommended by audiologists." (social proof)
5. "The hearing training approach your audiologist learned in school — now in an app." (curiosity)
